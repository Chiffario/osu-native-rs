# osu-native-rs

Provides native bindings for [osu-native](https://github.com/minisbett/osu-native-new)

NOTE: Pre-pre-alpha, osu-native itself isn't stable and neither is this crate. Until osu-native is stable, this crate will NOT be correctly versioned, as I really can't bother doing that before I have some stability guarantees from the main dependency

# Coverage

Coverage is mostly defined in [COVERAGE.md](/COVERAGE.md)

# Testing

All public APIs have standard test coverage, `cargo test` and `cargo nextest run` are your friends
